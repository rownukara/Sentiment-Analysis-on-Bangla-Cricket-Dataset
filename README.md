# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Bangla-Cricket-Dataset-by-LSTM
Here I used LSTM to do sentiment analysis.
LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, and it is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
LSTMs are designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.


The dataset i have used is from https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/3/2/15 .The Cricket dataset consists of 2900 different comments from different online sources with
five different aspect categories.
